+    plus   
-    minus
*    asterisk
/    forward slash
()   parentheses


Python also carries out multiplication and division, using an asterisk to indicat
e multiplication and a forward slash to indicate division. 

Use parentheses to determine which operations are performed first.
>>> 2 * (3 + 4)
14
>>> 10 / 2
5.0

Using a single slash to divide numbers produces a decimal (or float, as it is called in programming). 
We'll have more about floats in a later lesson.
