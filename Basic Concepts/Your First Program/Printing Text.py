//The print statement can also be used to output multiple lines of text.
//For Example:

print('Hello world!')
print('Hello world!')
print('Spam and eggs...')

//Python code often contains referencesto the comedy group Monty Python.This is why
//the words,"spanm" and "eggs" are soften used as placeholder variables in Python where
"foo" and "bar" would be used in other programming languages.
